## Decision Tree Classifiers implemented :  
1. Quinlan's ID3  (using information gain) 
2. C4.5 (using gain ratio) 
3. CART (using gini index)

## Validation
I've used cross validation here. 

## Observation
The accuracy of various decision tree algorithms based on cross validation are:
1. ID3 : 94.00 +/- 5.84%
2. C4.5 : 92.67% +/- 7.34% 
3. CART: 94.00% +/- 4.92%

We can observe that all three algorithms are close in their perfomance with Iris Dataset, although CART is most efficient and suited for decision tree in general. Here, CART and ID3 both give the best result.
